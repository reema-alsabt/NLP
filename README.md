Twitter Hate Speech Detection 

Twitter and other social networking sites are being used increasingly to spread hate speech. Several recent studies have also shown that the expression of hate speech leads to hate crimes such as Islamophobic attacks. Due to the increasing popularity of social media sites and the negative societal effects of hateful speech, it is crucial to develop automated tools for detecting hateful speech. Our goal in this research is to develop a natural language processing model for detecting hate speech on Twitter. Our review of previous studies indicates that the BERT model consistently results in effective measures. We will therefore be using the BERT base model as our NLP method to detect hateful speech from hugging face transformers along with the BERTokenizer to preprocess the data. This study will make use of the Kaggle dataset, which includes 25,296 tweets classified as offensive, hateful, or neither. We also utilized the Python language, TensorFlow, and NumPy. Therefore, our primary objective is to attain high levels of accuracy and reduce error rates. Meanwhile, the unbalanced data was rectified by obtaining the tweets that were strongly classified and categorized by CrowdFlower workers, resulting in 17,481 remaining tweets. Our analysis revealed that after filtering out the weakly classified tweets, our model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.09%, surpassing the BERT benchmark models and the unfiltered Kaggle dataset.
